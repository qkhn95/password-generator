# password-generator

### 1 - Added the password criteria

Added the criteria for the password (uppercase, lowercase numbers and special characters)

### 2 - Added script for password length

As the requirements are for the password to be between 8-128 characters I have added the code for this to happen in the getPasswordLength const value
